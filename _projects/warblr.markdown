description:  Warblr is an app for people who are interested in listening to music based on their mood and the type of music they are interested in. It allows for the user to choose a mood and style of music and generates a playlist through Spotify. Unlike Spotify itself, a user doesn't have to choose an artist or song to build a playlist.
