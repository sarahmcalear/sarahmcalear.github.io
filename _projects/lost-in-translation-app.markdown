description:  The Lost in Translation App is an app for all people interested who have travelled or dealt with different cultures and languages. It collects sayings or idioms from around the world and translates them literally into English. It also provides the original saying and the actual meaning of the idiom. Unlike a traditional translation app, this is meant to be fun and to learn a little bit about why literal translation doesn't always work.
