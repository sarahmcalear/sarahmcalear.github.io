description:  The Progress Notes App is an app for Special Ed teachers who have many students and limited time to take down daily notes. It allows for quick access to see old notes and makes it possible for other instructors who are also assigned to the same students to view the behavior and performance of the student in other classes. Unlike the traditional paper system it facilitates communication and tracking amongst teachers.
