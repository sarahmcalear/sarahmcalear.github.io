<div id="about-content">
  <p>I just completed the 12-week-long Web Development Immersive at General Assembly.</p>

  <p>During this time we covered Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Redis, Javascript, jQuery, Firebase, PostgreSQL, HTML5/CSS3, APIs, Markdown, Wireframing, Jasmine, RSpec, AJAX, Version Control Systems (Git, Github), ORM (Active Record), HTTP protocols, OAuth, OOP, TDD, and BDD.</p>

  <p>My previous experience with Speech-Language-Pathology allows me to have a better understanding of the process of explicitly and clearly including all information necessary to make an app work as well as communicating with my peers effectively.</p>

  <p>I enjoy part of building digital products, a positive environment, and am excited to join a team where I can contribute to both.</p>
